# Deng-Cyber: Threat Analysis Examples

# Step One: Initial Threat Detection
In the initial step of threat analysis, we focus on detecting potential threats. This involves monitoring network traffic, analyzing system logs, and identifying anomalies that could indicate malicious activity.

Key actions in this step include:

Network Traffic Analysis: Use tools like Wireshark or Snort to capture and inspect packets.
Log Review: Examine logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and servers for unusual patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Implement machine learning models to detect deviations from normal behavior.
Step Two: Threat Evaluation and Prioritization
Once potential threats are detected, the next step is to evaluate and prioritize them based on their severity and impact on the system.

Key actions in this step include:

Threat Classification: Categorize threats by type (e.g., malware, phishing, DDoS).
Risk Assessment: Assess the potential damage and likelihood of each threat.
Prioritization: Rank threats to address the most critical ones first.
